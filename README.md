# JS Kata
A simple code challenge to test Javascript knowledge.
Implement an export from `index.js` by making the failing tests pass!

## Getting Started
- `yarn install`
- `npm test`
- Getting the first test passing is a big step! That should be enough to get the other five passing.

## Consider
Passing this challenge is not the goal. Seeing how someone approaches implementing a solution is what is valuable.
