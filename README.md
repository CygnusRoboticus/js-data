# JS Kata
A simple code challenge to test Javascript knowledge.
Implement an export by making the failing tests pass!

## Getting Started
- `yarn install`
- `npm test`
- Walk them through getting the first test passing. That should be enough to get them going for the other three!

## Consider
Passing this challenge is not the goal. Seeing how someone approaches implementing a solution is what is valuable!
